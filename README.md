# Description

My follow-along course files from Pluralsight course [Electron Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/electron-fundamentals/table-of-contents).

This course covers basics of building applications using the Electron Framework, which allows building cross-platform applications based on webview technology - similar to wrapping a raw browser window into an application and run local web pages from a directory or with a local web server.

Electron powers apps like the Visual Studio Code IDE (on which I am typing this), Slack, and the Atom IDE.
